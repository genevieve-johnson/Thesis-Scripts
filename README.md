# Thesis-Scripts
Python scripts for thesis - prediction, annotation, analysis on bacteriophage genomes

Packages used: os, walking, numpy, Biopython, SeqIO, pandas

I have written several scripts to assist in sorting through and analyzing my sequence data for my thesis project. The main point of this project is to look at bacteriophage diversity and to compare a few specific phage genes. I have uploaded some of the larger scripts written for this project including a script to concatenate or separate contigs into one large file or each into their own file.
